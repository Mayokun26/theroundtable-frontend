  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 15, 2026</p>

  <p>Sylas Software ("we", "our", "us") operates The Round Table mobile application (the "App"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of personal information when you use our App.</p>

  <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
  <p>The Round Table does not require you to create an account or provide any personal information to use the App. We do not collect, store, or process any personally identifiable information.</p>

  <h2>Conversations</h2>
  <p>Conversations you have with historical characters are processed in real time by third-party AI services to generate responses. We do not store conversation history on our servers beyond the duration of your active session. Once you close a conversation, the data is discarded.</p>

  <h2>Analytics</h2>
  <p>We do not use any third-party analytics or tracking services. We do not collect usage data, device information, or behavioral data.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>The App uses OpenAI's API to generate character responses. Your conversation prompts are sent to OpenAI for processing. Please refer to <a href="https://openai.com/privacy">OpenAI's Privacy Policy</a> for information on how they handle data.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Since we do not collect any personal information from any users, no special provisions for children are necessary.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.</p>

  <h2>Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us by opening an issue at <a href="https://github.com/Mayokun26/theroundtable-frontend/issues">our GitHub repository</a>.</p>
