  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p class="updated">Last updated: February 26, 2026</p>

  <p>Sylas Software ("we", "our", "us") operates The Round Table mobile application (the "App"). This page informs you of our policies regarding the collection, use, and disclosure of information when you use our App.</p>

  <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>The Round Table does not require you to create an account or provide any personal information. We do not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, or other personally identifiable information. The only data we process is the text you type into conversations, which is used solely to generate AI-powered character responses.</p>

  <h2>How We Collect Data</h2>
  <p>When you send a message in a conversation, your message text and recent conversation context (prior messages in the same session) are transmitted from the App to our server, which then forwards them to a third-party AI service for response generation. No data is collected passively or in the background.</p>

  <h2>How Your Data Is Used</h2>
  <p>Your conversation messages are used exclusively to generate character responses in real time. We do not use your data for advertising, profiling, or any purpose beyond powering the conversation experience. Conversation data is held in temporary server memory only for the duration of your active session and is discarded when the session ends.</p>

  <h2>Third-Party Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>Your conversation messages are sent to <strong>OpenAI</strong> (OpenAI, L.L.C.) via their API to generate character responses. OpenAI processes your messages under their data usage policies. For API usage, OpenAI states that data sent through the API is not used to train their models. Please refer to <a href="https://openai.com/privacy">OpenAI's Privacy Policy</a> for full details on how they handle data. No other third parties receive your data.</p>

  <h2>Analytics</h2>
  <p>We do not use any third-party analytics or tracking services. We do not collect usage data, device information, or behavioral data.</p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>The App does not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13. Since we do not collect any personal information from any users, no special provisions for children are necessary.</p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Changes will be posted on this page with an updated revision date.</p>

  <h2>Contact Us</h2>
  <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us by opening an issue at <a href="https://github.com/Mayokun26/theroundtable-frontend/issues">our GitHub repository</a>.</p>
